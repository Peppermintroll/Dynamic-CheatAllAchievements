= Inter-Party Relationships

The <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> cannot govern by itself yet. Because we do not have an electoral majority, we need the support of other parties. Recently, our governments have consisted of the <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> Coalition of the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>, <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>, and [? if ddp_name == "DDP" and not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**Democratic**</span>?][? if ddp_name == "DStP" and not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**State**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**Liberal People's**</span>?] parties. [? if cvp_formed: However the formation of the <span style="color: #000000;">**[+ z_party_name +]**</span> has only really made cooperation with the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">liberals</span> possible. ?] We can reach out and build additional connections with these parties, or perhaps we can stand alone.

The <span style="color: #700000;">communists</span> are suspicious of our overtures, especially the <span style="color: #8B0000;">Stalinist</span> leadership, who persist in calling us "<span style="color: #c00000;">social</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span>". However, connections are made at the grassroots and local levels.

@kpd_rectification_of_history

One stumbling block for our relations with the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> is our history of conflict, dating back to 1918 and 1919. The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> is especially contemptuous of Gustav Noske, the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> "bloodhound" who reportedly ordered the violent suppression of the <span style="color: #700000;">Spartacist</span> uprising and other <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> revolts. They also blame us for the deaths of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, two <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>-turned-<span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> leaders who were killed during the suppression of the uprising.

For further improvements in <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> relations, it might be necessary to expel Noske, and hold some sort of commemoration for Luxemburg and Liebknecht.

- @yes_history: Yes, we must apologize for our past actions.
- @no_history: No, we have no need to apologize.

As part of normalizing relations with the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>, we have to acknowledge the wrongdoings of our past. We have expelled Noske, and have held public commemorations for those killed by troops during the uprisings.

This leads to tensions with the moderates and reformists within our party, and criticism from the <span style="color: #000000;">conservative</span> and <span style="color: #C0A054;">liberal</span> parties.

@no_history
on-arrival: kpd_relation -= 3

We have no need to apologize for the actions of Ebert and Noske; it is the <span style="color: #700000;">communists</span>' fault for launching a violent insurrection.

We are currently coalition partners with them, so improving relations comes naturally.

It's not exactly easy to get the <span style="color: #000000;">Christians</span> to like us again—but it's not impossible either.
